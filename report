- Capture network traffic on a live network interface.
- Identify and analyze common network protocols and traffic patterns.
- Generate a packet capture file (`.pcap`) and a concise analysis report.

## Tools

- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) â€“ Free and open-source network protocol analyzer.

## How to Use

1. **Install Wireshark** on your computer.
2. **Start capturing** packets on your active network interface (e.g., Ethernet or Wi-Fi).
3. **Save the capture** as a `.pcap` file, preferably in the `captures/` directory.
4. **Analyze** the capture in Wireshark to identify protocols and traffic types.
5. Review the `report.md` for a summary of findings.
